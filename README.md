# Crud-operations
Firstly, We define four functions to handle each of the CRUD operations: createContact, readContact, updateContact, and deleteContact.
In this code, we define a "Contact" structure that represents a single contact with a name and phone number.We use a vector to store all the contacts.
The "createContact" function prompts the user for a name and phone number and adds a new Contact object to the contacts vector.
The "readContact" function prompts the user for a phone number and searches the contacts vector for a matching phone number. 
If it finds a matching phone number, it displays the corresponding name. Otherwise, it displays an error message.
The "updateContact" function prompts the user for a phone number and searches the contacts vector for a matching phone number. 
The "deleteContact" function prompts the user for a phone number and searches the contacts vector for a matching phone number.
If it finds a matching phone number, it removes the corresponding Contact object from the contacts vector
